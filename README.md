# DistributedDataPipelineQA

This project contains a test suite built using Playwright to analyze and validate data logged in an `events.log` file. The suite performs data analysis on the log file, generates a report, and then compares the report with the original log data to ensure accuracy.

## Project Structure

- **data_analyzer_validator.spec.js**: The main test suite that contains two test cases:
  1. **Analyze data from events.log and generate a report**: This test reads and parses the `events.log` file, performs a basic analysis, and generates a `data_analysis_report.txt` file.
  2. **Compare data analysis report with events.log**: This test compares the generated report with the original log file to ensure that the report accurately reflects the data.

- **events.log**: The log file generated by the application, containing the data to be analyzed.
- **data_analysis_report.txt**: The report generated by the test suite, summarizing the analysis of the log file.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v12 or later)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Playwright

### InstallationInstall Playwright:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bennhub/DistributedDataPipelineQA.git
   cd DistributedDataPipelineQA
2. Install dependencies::
   ```bash
   npm install
2. Install Playwright::
   ```bash
   npx playwright install
4. Ensure you have the required services or scripts in place that generate the **events.log** file. This could be any application or set of processes that logs data to the file. 

### Running the Tests
You can run the test suite using Playwright. The suite includes environment setup, running the tests, and cleanup.   

### Test Cases

**Analyze Data from events.log and Generate a Report**

**Objective:** Reads the content of events.log, performs analysis, and generates data_analysis_report.txt.
**Validation:** Verifies that both the log and report files exist and the report accurately summarizes the log data.

**Compare Data Analysis Report with events.log**

**Objective:** Compares the contents of data_analysis_report.txt with events.log to ensure no discrepancies.
**Validation:** Verifies that all entries in the report match the corresponding entries in the log file.

**Cleanup:**
The test suite includes a cleanup process that stops the services and removes the events.log and data_analysis_report.txt files after the tests are complete.

### Troubleshooting
Ensure that your environment is correctly set up before running the tests. The services that generate the events.log file should be running.
If the tests fail due to missing log or report files, check that the files are being generated correctly by your application.
